## About 

Matthew Baron was born and raised in the glass city, Toledo Ohio. From there, he attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA where he graduated with a dual degree; Electrical & Computer Engineering and Hispanic Studies in 2014. For the 2017-2018 academic year, he returned to CMU and completed a MS in ECE with a focus on Machine Learning for Signal Processing.

Current projects build on passion and background in signal processing, as he focuses on acoustics, image processing, and signal processing on graphs.

In late July 2020, he was laid off from his engineering position as a consequence of the economic factors of COVID-19. Instead of jumping back into the job search, he decided to self-sponsor as a "professional" athelete. He tries to update this blog weekly with thoughts and ideas related to his training.
